Secure Transmission: Use HTTPS for all traffic, not just for login pages. This ensures that user credentials are always sent over an encrypted connection.
Session Management: Implement secure session management. This includes setting session timeouts, regenerating session IDs after login, and securely handling cookies.
Audit Logging: Keep a record of all successful and failed login attempts. This can help detect and investigate suspicious activities.
